# Use the -relax parameter when linking?
# Passing -O9 and -relax to the linker saves a bit of flash,
# but the option is broken in certain binutils versions.
# (known troublemakers: binutils 2.17, 2.18 seems fine)

CONFIG_MCU_FREQ=8000000

# Display buffer size
# This buffer is used during reception of I2C messages,
# data that doesn't fit will be silently dropped.
CONFIG_I2C_BUFFER_SIZE=40

# Maximum number of menu entries
# This is the maximum number of menu entries that can
# be used. Further entries are silently dropped,
# the actual number of menu entries may be lower than this
# limit if there isn't enough free ram to store the text.
